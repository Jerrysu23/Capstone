# JobQuery

## Description
JobQuery is a web application that scrapes and displays new graduate and internship job listings. This site allows for the user to use many different features
such as filters, savings jobs, saving resumes, getting resume improvement help, and much more. Refer to our abstract below for more information!

## Abstract
JobQuery will be mainly focused on helping new graduates and interns find employment options due to the fact that many job application websites make the job search difficult for this demographic of job searchers. In the current market, it is very difficult for inexperienced early career job seekers to be considered for the right positions. JobQuery will aggregate online job listings based on user provided keywords/inputs and find jobs that match closest to what they are looking for. The keywords that the users can choose can range from what kind of industry, experience, full time/part time, location, onsite/remote, etc. When the user is finished with inputting what they are looking for, JobQuery will generate links to the official job page website. Beyond that, it will also provide a multitude of features such as an AI resume helper, a resume bin, advanced filtering, and much more! Our goal is to make an already stressful task (job searching) less stressful.
